<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prosthetic Heart Valve/ Artificial Heart Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valve</li><li>Tissue Heart Valve</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The prosthetic heart valve market is categorized into three main types: transcatheter heart valves, tissue heart valves, and mechanical heart valves. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive devices delivered via catheter, ideal for high-risk patients. Tissue heart valves, made from animal or human tissues, offer a natural feel and reduced risk of clotting but may require replacement over time. Mechanical heart valves are durable, made from synthetic materials, and are suitable for younger patients, though they necessitate lifelong anticoagulation therapy.</p></p>
