<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fusing Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resettable Fuse Resistor</li><li>One-time Fuse Resistor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fusing resistor market consists of two primary types: resettable fuse resistors and one-time fuse resistors. Resettable fuse resistors, also known as polyfuses, can recover and restore functionality after the fault condition is removed, making them suitable for applications requiring repeated use. In contrast, one-time fuse resistors are designed to permanently disconnect the circuit once a fault occurs, providing a reliable solution for overcurrent protection in critical applications. Both types are essential for enhancing circuit safety and durability.</p></p>
